Sir,
    I am Manish kumar Agarwal from India. I have opted for the CS50 course for web development. This is my first project related to programming.
    Sir, I have made this project on the recent pandemic situation covid-19 which displays information related to it. This project contains four html pages out of which one of them is homepage containing basic information related to covid-19.Aarogya setu page is a government web interface that helps in identification of person who has a travel history in abroad in the past month. CovidTracker page helps to track the ongoing cases in different states of our country. And, NizamuddinMarkazCase is the most highlighted case of the covid-19 in india and shows the utter negligence of a certain community that led to increased covid cases.
       This project covers every requirement for project0 except for the scss variable since i faced repeatative issues regarding the installment of sass file and nodejs software on my pc. 

Thanking you.
